This <a href= https://www.autohotkey.com/>AHK Script</a> fixes the sniper spread when noscoping
by automatically scoping in with a macro.
</p>

<p align="center">
This macro is completely legit, and allowed by the <a href= https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use/>Roblox TOS</a>,
and War Tycoon rules.

This is my first complete AHK script. It's not close to completion.
